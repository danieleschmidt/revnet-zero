# RevNet-Zero Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: RevNet-Zero  
**Project Type**: Open Source Machine Learning Library  
**Start Date**: January 2025  
**Current Phase**: Foundation Development  

## Problem Statement

Current transformer architectures face severe memory limitations when training with long context windows, requiring prohibitively expensive hardware for 256k+ token sequences. Standard transformers store O(L × B × S × D) activations, where even moderate-sized models quickly exceed available GPU memory for long contexts.

**Key Problems**:
- 7B parameter models with 256k context require 300GB+ GPU memory
- Long-context training is accessible only to large organizations
- Research on long-range dependencies is severely constrained
- Energy consumption for long-context training is unsustainable

## Vision Statement

**"Democratize long-context transformer training through reversible computing, enabling 256k+ token training on consumer hardware with 70%+ memory reduction."**

## Project Scope
