## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security@revnet-zero.org with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)

## Security Measures

RevNet-Zero implements several security measures:

### Code Security
- Regular dependency updates
- Automated security scanning
- Code review requirements
- Signed releases

### Data Protection
- No collection of sensitive user data
- Minimal logging of training information
- Secure handling of model weights
- Optional encryption for saved models

### Infrastructure Security
- Secure CI/CD pipelines
- Protected main branch
- Required code reviews
- Automated vulnerability scanning

## Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Severity Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: 2-4 weeks (depending on complexity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released

## Security Best Practices

When using RevNet-Zero:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update to the latest version
2. **Secure Training Data**: Ensure training data doesn't contain sensitive information
3. **Model Protection**: Consider encrypting saved model files
4. **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls for training infrastructure
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual memory usage or performance patterns

## Known Security Considerations

### Memory Access Patterns
- Reversible layers may have different memory access patterns
- Monitor for potential side-channel vulnerabilities
- Use secure memory allocation in sensitive environments

### Gradient Information
- Recomputed gradients may leak training information
- Consider differential privacy techniques for sensitive data
- Implement gradient clipping for privacy protection

### Model Extraction
- Long-context models may be more vulnerable to extraction attacks
- Implement query limiting and output filtering
- Consider watermarking techniques for model protection
